About the Dataset

The Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning and medical research. It is often used for classification tasks to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on various features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.

Source
This dataset is available from multiple sources, but one of the most common and official sources is the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Here is a brief overview of the dataset:

Original Source: Dr. William H. Wolberg, University of Wisconsin.

Dataset Characteristics: Multivariate

Number of Instances: 569

Number of Attributes: 30 numeric, predictive attributes, and the class attribute.

Attribute Information: The attributes are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass and describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. The features are:

Radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
Texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
Perimeter
Area
Smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
Compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
Concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
Concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
Symmetry
Fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)
